# ComputerGraphics
This repository contains various projects I have created within the realm of computer graphics that I am proud of! In a sense, this repo is a compilation of my progress in studying computer graphics. Currently, I am providing my main source code file and executables for each project. As my imagination and knowledge continue to grow, I will upload more projects.

## Projects:
- Rotating Colorful Letters: Use keyboard commands to increase the rotation speed and scaling rate
- Transform Colorful Letters 3D: Use mouse + keyboard commands to rotate, scale, and translate the letters.
- Letters Orbiting Cube: Two-dimensional letters orbiting a three-dimensional cube. (coming soom)
