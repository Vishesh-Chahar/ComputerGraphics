# Transform Colorful Letters 3D

The letters "JDTII" (my initials) are created using an array of three-dimensional points. These points are then connected together to form triangle primitives that compose each individual letter. The points in each letter are assigned colors. The rasterizer does the work of interpolating the colors and deciding what color each pixel should display.

## Commands:
- Scroll (mouse wheel): Rotate letters about the Z-axis
- Left-click and drag: Rotate letters about the X-axis and the Y-axis
- Shift + left-click and drag: Translate (move) the letters
- Shift + scroll: Scale the letters.
