# Rotating Colorful Letters
The letters "JDTII" (my initials) are created using an array of two-dimensional points. These points are then connected together to form triangle primitives that compose each individual letter. The points in each letter are assigned colors. The rasterizer does the work of interpolating the colors and deciding what color each pixel should display.
